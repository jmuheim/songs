## Intro



## Verse 1

[D] Words are flowing out [Bm]  
like endless [F#m] rain into a paper cup  
They [Em7] slither wildly as they slip away  
a[A]cross the [A7] universe

[D] Pools of sorrow, [Bm] waves of joy  
are [F#m] drifting through my opened mind  
Poss[Em7]essing and car[Gm]essing me

## Chorus

[D] Jai guru deva om [A7sus4]

[A] Nothing's gonna change my world [A7]  
[G] Nothing's gonna change my world [D] _(x2)_

## Verse 2

[D] Images of [Bm] broken light which  
[F#m] dance before me like a million [Em7] eyes  
They call me on and on  
a[A]cross the [A7] universe

[D] Thoughts meander [Bm] like a restless  
[F#m] wind inside a letterbox  
They [Em7] tumble blindly  
as they make their [A] way  
across the [A7] universe

## Chorus

[D] Jai guru deva om [A7sus4]

[A] Nothing's gonna change my world [A7]  
[G] Nothing's gonna change my world [D] _(x2)_

## Verse 3

[D] Sounds of laughter, [Bm] shades of life  
are [F#m] ringing through my opened ears  
In[Em7]citing and in[Gm]viting me  

[D] Limitless, un[Bm]dying love  
which [F#m]shines around me like  
a million [Em7] suns and calls me on and on   
a[A]cross the universe [A7]

## Chorus

[D] Jai guru deva om [A7sus4]

[A] Nothing's gonna change my world [A7]  
[G] Nothing's gonna change my world [D] _(x2)_

## Outro

[D] Jai guru deva om [A7sus4] _(Repeat and fade)
