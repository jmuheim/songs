# As long as you love me (Backstreet Boys)

## Intro

[C] [G] [Em] [D]  
As long as you love me

_(Repeat)_

## Verse 1

Although [Em] loneliness has always been  
a [C] friend of mine  
I'm [D] leavin' my life in your hands [G] [D]  
[Em] People say I'm crazy and that [C] I am blind  
[D] Risking it all in a glance [G] [D]

And [Em] how you got me blind is still a [C] mystery  
I [D] can't get you out of my head [G] [D]  
[Em] Don't care what is written in your [C] history  
As [D] long as you're here with me [G]

## Chorus

I don't care who [C] you are  
Where [G] you're from  
What [Em] you did  
As long [D] as you love me

_(Repeat)_

## Verse 2

[Em] Every little thing that you have [C] said and done  
Feels [D] like it's deep within me [G] [D]  
[Em] Doesn't really matter if you're [C] on the run  
It [D] seems like we're [G] meant to be [D]

## Chorus

I don't care who [C] you are  
Where [G] you're from  
What [Em] you did  
As long [D] as you love me (yeah)

_(Repeat)_

[C] [G] [Em] [D] _(x2)_

## Bridge

[Em] I've tried to hide it so that [G] no one knows  
But I [C] guess it shows  
When you [C] look into my eyes [D]  

[Em] What you did and where you're [G] comin from  
I don't [D] care, [C] as long [D] as you [C] love me, baby  
[G] [D] [Em] [C] [D]

## Chorus

I don't care who [C] you are  
Where [G] you're from  
What [Em] you did  
As long [D] as you love me

_(Repeat and fade)_
