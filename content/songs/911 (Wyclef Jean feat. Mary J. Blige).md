# 911 (Wyclef Jean feat. Mary J. Blige)

## Intro (Wyclef)

[Am] Yo, what's up, this is Wyclef with Mary J. [Em]  
[Dm] I serenade the girls with my accoustic guitar  
[C] You know what I'm sayin'? [Em] _(Mary: Uuuuuh)_

[Am] Yo, fellas havin' problems with the chicks? [Em]  
[Dm] I want you right now to turn the lights down low  
[C] Pull your girl up next to you  
[Em] I want you to sing this to her

## Verse 1 (Wyclef)

If death comes for me to[Am]night, girl [Em]  
I want you to know that I [Dm] loved you [C] [Em]  
And no mat[Am]ter how tough I wouldn't dare [Em]  
Only to you I would re[Dm]veal my tears [C] [Em]

So tell the [Am] police I ain't home tonight [Em]  
Messin' around with you is gonna [Dm] get me life [C] [Em]  
But when I [Am] look into your eyes [Em]  
(Man) You're worth that [Dm] sacrafice [C] [Em]

## Bridge (Wyclef)

If [Am] this is the kind of love  
That my mom used to [Em] warn me about  
Man, I'm in [Dm] trouble  
I'm in real big [C] trouble [Em]

If [Am] this is the kind of love  
That the old folks used to [Em] warn me about  
Man, I'm in [Dm] trouble  
I'm in real big [C] trouble [Em]  

(I need y'all to do me a favor)

## Chorus (Wyclef)

[Am] Someone please call 91[Em]1 (pick up the phone yo)  
[Dm] Tell them I just been shot [C] down  
and the [Em] bullet's in my [Am] heart  
And it's piercin through my [Em] soul (I'm losin blood yo)
[Dm] Feel my body gettin' [C] cold [Em]

[Am] Someone please call 91[Em]1 (pick up the phone yo)  
[Dm] The alleged assai[C]lant, is [Em] five foot [Am] one  
and she shot me through my [Em] soul [Dm]  
Feel my body gettin [C] cold [Em] (_Mary:_ so cold)

## Verse 2 (Mary)

Some[Am]times I feel like I'm a prisoner [Em]  
I think I'm trapped here [Dm] for a while [C] yeah [Em] yeah  
(_Wyclef:_ but I'm always right here with you girl)  
And [Am] every breath I fight to take [Em]  
Is as hard as these [Dm] four walls I wanna break [C] [Em]

I [Am] told the cops you wasn't here tonight [Em] (_Wyclef:_ right)  
Messin' around with me is gonna [Dm] get you life  
[C] Oh yeah, [Em] yeah  
But ev[Am]erytime I look into your eyes [Em]  
Then it's worth the [Dm] sacrifice [C] [Em]

## Bridge (Wyclef)

That your mom used to [Em] warn you about  
Mary, your are in [Dm] trouble (I am in real Big Trouble)  
You're in real big [C] trouble [Em] (_Mary:_ Lord Knows I am in trouble)

If [Am] this is the kind of love  
That the old folks used to [Em] warn me about  
(everyday, everynight) I'm in [Dm] trouble  
I'm in real big [C] trouble  
[Em] You got anything to say, girl?
