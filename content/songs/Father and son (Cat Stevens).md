## Intro

_(Riff x4)_
 
## Verse 1 - Father

It's not [G] time to make a change [D/F#]  
just relax [C] and take it ea[Am7]sy  
You're still [G] young, that's your fault [Em]  
there's so [Am] much you have to know [D]

Find a [G] girl, settle down [D/F#]  
if you want [C], you can mar[Am7]ry  
Look at me [G], I am old [Em]  
but I'm [Am] happy [D]

---

I was [G] once like you are now [D]  
and I know [C] that it's not ea[Am7]sy  
To be [G] calm when you've found [Em]  
something [Am] going on [D]

But take your time [G], think a lot [D]  
why think of ev[C]erything you've got [Am7]  
For you will [G] still be here tomorrow [Em]  
but your [Am] dreams [D] may [G] not

_(Riff x2)_

## Verse 2 - Son

How can I [G] try to explain? [Bm]  
'cause when I [C] do he turns a[Am7]way again  
It's al[G]ways been the same [Em]  
same old [Am] story [D]

From the mo[G]ment I could talk [Bm]  
I was or[C]dered to lis[Am7]ten  
Now there's a way [G], and I know [Em] that I [D] have to go away [G]  
I [D] know I [C] have to [G] go

_(Riff x2)_

## Interlude

_(Instrumental)_

[G] [D] [C] [Am7]  
[G] [Em] [Am] [C] [D]  
[G] [D] [C] [Am7]  
[G] [Em] [D] [G]  
[D] [C] [G]

## Verse 3 - Father

It's not [G] time to make a change [D/F#]  
just ~~relax~~ **sit down** [C] and take it ~~easy~~ **slow[Am7]ly**  
You're still [G] young, that's your fault [Em]  
there's so [Am] much you have to ~~know~~ **go through** [D]

Find a [G] girl, settle down [D/F#]  
if you want [C], you can mar[Am7]ry  
Look at me [G], I am old [Em]  
but I'm [Am] happy [D]

## Verse 4 - Son

All the times [G] that I've cried [Bm]  
keeping all [C] the things I knew [Am7] inside  
It's hard [G]
but it's har[Em]der to ig[Am]nore it [D]

If they were right [G], I'd agree [Bm] _(I love this one!)_  
but it's them [C] they know, not me [Am7]
Now there's a way [G], and I know [Em]  
that I [D] have to go away [G]

I [D] know I [C] have to [G] go
