Your [Am] beauty is be[C]yond compare  
With [G] flaming locks of [Am] auburn hair  
With [G] ivory skin

Your [G] voice is soft like [Am] summer rain  
And [G] I cannot com[Em]pete with you

He [Am] talks about you [C] in his sleep  
There's [G] nothing I can [Am] do to keep  
From [G] crying when he [Em] calls your name

And [Am] I can easily [C] understand  
How [G] you could easily [Am] take my man  
But you [G] don't know what he [Em] means to me  
Jo[Am]lene

But [G] I could never [Am] love again  
[G] He's the only [Em] one for me

My [G] happiness de[Am]pends on you  
What[G]ever you de[Em]cide to do
