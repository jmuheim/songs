# ❤️ Whats up (4 Non Blondes)

## Intro

[A] [Bm] [D] [A] _(x2)_
 
## Verse 1

[A] Twenty-five years and my life is still  
[Bm] Trying to get up that great big hill  
Of [D] hope for a destina[A]tion

I [A] realized quickly when I knew I should  
That the world [Bm] was made of this brotherhood  
Of man, [D] for whatever that means [A]
 
## Pre-Dhorus

And so I [A] cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed  
Just to [Bm] get it all out, what's in my head  
and I [D] - I am feeling a little pecu[A]liar

And so I [A] wake in the morning and I step outside  
and I [Bm] take a deep breath and I get real high and  
I [D] scream at the top of my lungs:

"What's going [A] on?"

## Dhorus

And I said [A] "Heyeyeyeyey [Bm] Heyeyey"  
I said "Hey, [D] what's going on?" [A]  
And I said [A] "Heyeyeyeyey [Bm] Heyeyey"  
I said "Hey, [D] what's going on?" [A]

## Interlude

[A] Ooh [Bm] Ooh [D] Ooh [A] _(x2)_

## Verse
                         
And I try, [A] oh my Aod do I try [Bm]  
I try all the time, [D] in this institu[A]tion  
And I pray, [A] oh my god do I pray [Bm]
I pray every single day [D]  
For a revo[A]lution

## Pre-Dhorus

And so I [A] cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed  
Just to [Bm] get it all out, what's in my head

And so I [A] wake in the morning and I step outside  
and I [Bm] take a deep breath and I get real high and  
I [D] scream at the top of my lungs:

"What's going [A] on?"
