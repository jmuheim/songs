## Intro

[Am] [D/F#] [G] [C] [F] [Dm] [E] [Esus4] [E]  
La la la...
 
## Verse 1

[Am] Now that I've [D/F#] lost everything to [G] you  
You say you [C] wanna start something [F] new  
And it's [Dm] breaking my heart you're [E] leaving  
Baby I'm [Esus4] griev[E]ing

But [Am] if you wanna [D/F#] leave take good [G] care  
Hope you have a [C] lot of nice things to wear [F]  
But then a [Dm] lot of nice things turn  
[E] bad out[E7]there [G] [G7] [G6] [G5]

## Chorus

[C] Oh [G] baby, baby it's a [F] wild world  
[C] _(Riff 1)_  
[G] It's hard to get by [F] just upon a [C] smile  
[G] _(Riff 2)_

[Dm] [E]

## Verse 2

[Am] You know I've seen a [D/F#] lot of  
what the world can [G] do  
And it's [C] breaking my heart in [F] two  
'cause I [Dm] never want to see you [E] sad girl  
Don't be a [Esus4] bad [E] girl

But [Am] if you wanna [D/F#] leave take good [G] care  
Hope you make a [C] lot of nice friends out there [F]  
But just re[Dm]member there's a lot of bad  
[E] and be[E7]ware [G] [G7] [G6] [G5]
