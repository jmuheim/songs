# Introduction

## Welcome

This is a collection of Monika's first guitar songs.  
🎤😍🎸🔥

They only use the beginner-friendly open chords. Hence some of the songs have been simplified a bit or transposed to a different key (feel free to use a capo to re-adjust).

💫 Let's sing together and have some fun! 🌛 

##  ❤️ Happy birthday! ❤️
