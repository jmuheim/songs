## Chorus

[B] Trailer for [E] sale or rent  
[F#] rooms to let [B] fifty cents  
[B] No phone, no pool, [E] no pets  
[F#] I ain't got no cigarettes, ah but

[B] Two hours of [E] pushing broom buys an  
[F#] eight by twelve [B] fourbit room  
I'm a [B] man of [E] means by no means

[F#] King of the Road
 
## Verse 1

[B] Third box car [E] midnight train  
[F#] destination [B] Bangor, Maine  
[B] Old worn out [E] suit and shoes  
[F#] I don't pay no union dues

I smoke [B] old stogies [E] I have found  
[F#] short, but not too [B] big around  
I'm a [B] man of [E] means by no means

[F#] King of the Road

## Verse 2

I know [C] every engineer on [F] every train  
[G] All of the children and [C] all of their names  
And [C] every handout in [F] every town

And every [G] lock that ain't locked when  
No one's around

I sing...
