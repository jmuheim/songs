# Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen)

## Intro

[C] [G]

## Verse 1

Now I've [C] heard there was a [Am] secret chord  
That [C] David played, and it [Am] pleased the Lord  
But [F] you don't really [G] care for music, [C] do you? [G]

It [C] goes like this, the [F] fourth, the [G] fifth  
The [Am] minor fall, the [F] major lift  
The [G] baffled king [E] composing, halle[Am]lujah

## Chorus

Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah  
Galle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

## Verse 2

Your [C] faith was strong, but you [Am] needed proof  
You [C] saw her bathing [Am] on the roof  
Her [F] beauty and the [G] moonlight over[C]threw ya [G]

She [C] tied you to a [F] kitchen [G] chair  
She [Am] broke your throne, and she [F] cut your hair  
And [G] from your lips she [E] drew the [Am] hallelujah

## Chorus

Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah  
Galle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

## Verse 3

[C] Baby, I've been [Am] here before
I [C] know this room, I've [Am] walked this floor  
I [F]used to live a[G]lone before I [C] knew you [G]

I've [C] seen your flag on the [F] marble [G] arch  
[Am]Love is not a [F] victory march  
It's a [G] cold, and it's a [E] broken halle[Am]lujah

## Chorus

Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah  
Galle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

## Verse 4

There [C] was a time when you [Am] let me know  
What's [C] really going [Am] on below  
But [F] now you never [G] show it to me, [C] do you? [G]

And re[C]member when I [F] moved in [G] you  
The [Am] holy dove was [F] moving too  
And [G] every breath we [E] drew was halle[Am]lujah

## Chorus

Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah  
Galle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

## Verse 5

[C] Maybe there's a [Am] God above  
And [C] all I ever [Am] learned from love  
Was [F] how to shoot at [G] someone who out[C]drew you [G]

It's [C] not a cry you can [F] hear at [G] night  
It's [Am] not somebody who has [F] seen the light  
It's a [G] cold, and it's a [E] broken halle[Am]lujah

## Chorus

Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah  
Galle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

## Verse 6

You [C] say I took the [Am] name in vain  
Though [C] I don't even [Am] know the name  
But [F] if I did, well [G] really, what's it [C] to ya? [G]

There's a [C] blaze of light in [F] every [G] word  
It [Am] doesn't matter [F] which you heard  
The [G] holy or the [E] broken halle[Am]lujah

## Chorus

Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah  
Galle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]

## Verse 7

I [C] did my best, it [Am] wasn't much  
I [C] couldn't feel, so I [Am] tried to touch  
I've [F] told the truth, I [G] didn't come to [C] fool ya [G]

And [C] even though it [F] all went [G] wrong  
I'll [Am] stand before the [F] Lord of Song  
With [G] nothing on my [E] tongue but halle[Am]lujah

## Chorus

Halle[F]lujah, halle[Am]lujah  
Galle[F]lujah, halle[C]lu[G]jah [C] [G]
