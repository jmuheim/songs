## Intro

[Em] [Bm] [G] [F#] [Bm]

## Verse 1

If you want a [Em] lover  
I'll do anything you [D] ask me to.
And if you want an[Em]other kind of love  
I'll wear a [D] mask for you.

If you want a [Bm] partner take my hand  
or if you want to [G] strike me down in anger  
[A] here I stand  
I'm your man [Bm]

## Verse 2

If you want a [Em] boxer  
I will step into the [D] ring for you  
And if you want a [Em] doctor  
I'll examine every [D] inch of you

If you want a [Bm] driver climb inside  
Or if you want a [G] take me for a ride,  
You [A] know you can  
I'm your man [Bm]

## Bridge

Ah, the [D] moon's too bright  
the [G] chain's too tight  
the [A] beast won't go to [D] sleep

I've been [F#m] running through  
these promises to you  
that I made [Bm] and I could not keep

---

Ah, but a [F#] man never got a women back  
not by [Bm] begging on his knees  
Or I'd [G] crawl to you, baby  
and I'd [F#] fall at your feet

And I'd [G] howl at your beauty  
like a [F#] dog in heat  
And I'd [G] claw at your heart  
and I'd [E] tear at your sheet

I'd say: please [A]  
please, I'm your man [Bm]

## Verse 3

And if you've [Em] got to sleep a moment  
on the road, I will [D] steer for you  
And if you want to [Em] walk the street alone  
I'll disa[D]ppear for you

If you want a [Bm] father for your child  
or only want to [G] walk with me  
a while across the [A] sand  
I'm your man [Bm]

## Verse 1

_(Fade out slowly)_

If you want a [Em] lover  
I'll do anything you [D] ask me to.
And if you want an[Em]other kind of love  
I'll wear a [D] mask for you.

If you want a [Bm] driver climb inside  
Or if you want a [G] take me for a ride,  
You [A] know you can  
I'm your man [Bm]
