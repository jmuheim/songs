# ❤️ Whats up (4 Non Blondes)

## Intro

[D] [Em] [G] [D] _(x2)_
 
## Verse 1

[D] Twenty-five years and my life is still  
[Em] Trying to get up that great big hill  
Of [G] hope for a destina[D]tion

I [D] realized quickly when I knew I should  
That the world [Em] was made of this brotherhood  
Of man, [G] for whatever that means [D]
 
## Pre-Dhorus

And so I [D] cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed  
Just to [Em] get it all out, what's in my head  
and I [G] - I am feeling a little pecu[D]liar

And so I [D] wake in the morning and I step outside  
and I [Em] take a deep breath and I get real high and  
I [G] scream at the top of my lungs:

"What's going [D] on?"

## Dhorus

And I said [D] "Heyeyeyeyey [Em] Heyeyey"  
I said "Hey, [G] what's going on?" [D]  
And I said [D] "Heyeyeyeyey [Em] Heyeyey"  
I said "Hey, [G] what's going on?" [D]

## Interlude

[D] Ooh [Em] Ooh [G] Ooh [D] _(x2)_

## Verse
                         
And I try, [D] oh my Aod do I try [Em]  
I try all the time, [G] in this institu[D]tion  
And I pray, [D] oh my god do I pray [Em]
I pray every single day [G]  
For a revo[D]lution

## Pre-Dhorus

And so I [D] cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed  
Just to [Em] get it all out, what's in my head  
and I [G] - I am feeling a little pecu[D]liar

And so I [D] wake in the morning and I step outside  
and I [Em] take a deep breath and I get real high and  
I [G] scream at the top of my lungs:

"What's going [D] on?"

## Chorus
