## Verse 1

[Dm] Save me from drowning in the sea [Dm6]  
[Am] Beat me up on the beach  
[Dm]What a lovely holiday [E7(1)]  
There's nothing funny left to say [Asus] [Am]

[Dm] This sombre song would drain the sun [Dm6]  
[Am] But it won't shine until it's sung  
[Dm] No water running in the stream [E7(2)]  
The saddest place we've ever seen [A7sus4] [A7]

## Bridge 1

[F/A] Everything I touched was gol[G7]den  
Everything I loved got [C] broken  
On the road to Mandalay

[F] Every mistake I've ever made [Em]  
Has been rehashed and then re[Dm]played  
As I got lost along the way [G]

## Chorus

[X] Bum bum bum [Dm] ba da dum bum bum [G]  
Bum bum bum [C] ba da dum bum bum [Am]

Bum bum bum [F] ba da dum, bum bum [G]  
Bum ba dum [Am]

## Verse 2

[Dm] There's nothing left for you to give [Dm6]  
[Am] The truth is all that you're left with  
[Dm] Twenty paces then at dawn [E7(1)]  
We will [E7] die and be reborn [Asus] [Am]

[Dm] I like to sleep beneath the trees [Dm6]  
[Am] Have the universe at one with me  
[Dm] Look down the barrel of a gun [E7(2)]  
And feel the moon replace the sun [A7sus4] [A7]

## Bridge 2

[F/A] Everything we've ever sto[G7]len  
Has been lost returned or [C] broken  
No more dragons left to slay

[F] Every mistake I've ever made [Em]  
Has been rehashed and then re[Dm]played  
As I got lost along the way [G]

## Chorus

[X] Bum bum bum [Dm] ba da dum bum bum [G]  
Bum bum bum [C] ba da dum bum bum [Am]

Bum bum bum [F] ba da dum, bum bum [G]  
Bum ba dum [Am]

_(x3)_

## Solo

_(Instrumental)_

[Dm] [G] [C] [Am] [F] [G] [Am]

## Outro

[Dm] Save me from drowning in the sea [Dm6]  
[Am] Beat me up on the beach  
[Dm]What a lovely holiday [E7(1)]  
There's nothing funny left to say [Am]
