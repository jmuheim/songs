# Don't worry be happy (Bobby McFerrin)

## Intro

_(Instrumental)_

[G] [Am] [C] [G]

## Verse 1

[G] Here's a little song I wrote  
You [Am] might want to sing it note for note   
Don't [C] worry, be [G] happy

In [G] every life we have some trouble  
[Am] When you worry you make it double  
Don't [C] worry, be [G] happy 
 
## Chorus

(Whistle)

[G] [Am] [C] [G] (x2)

## Verse 2

[G] Ain't got no place to lay your head  
[Am] Somebody came and took your bed  
Don't [C] worry, be [G] happy  

The [G] landlord say your rent is late  
[Am] He may have to litigate  
Don't [C] worry, be [G] happy

## Chorus

(Whistle)

[G] [Am] [C] [G] (x2)

## Verse 3

[G] Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style  
[Am] Ain't got no girl to make you smile  
**But** don't [C] worry, be [G] happy

Cause [G] when you worry, your face will frown  
[Am] And that will bring everybody down  
**So** don't [C] worry, be [G] happy

## Chorus

(Whistle)

[G] [Am] [C] [G] (x2)

## Verse 4

[G] There is this little song I wrote  
[Am] I hope you learn it note for note  
Don't [C] worry, be [G] happy

(Listen to what I say!)

[G] In your life expect some trouble 
[Am] But when you worry, you make it double 
Don't [C] worry, be [G] happy

## Chorus

(Whistle)

[G] [Am] [C] [G] (x2)

_(Repeat and fade)_
