# Don't worry be happy (Bobby McFerrin)

## Intro

_(Instrumental)_

[B] [C#m] [E] [B]

## Verse 1

[B] Here's a little song I wrote  
You [C#m] might want to sing it note for note   
Don't [E] worry, be [B] happy

In [B] every life we have some trouble  
[C#m] When you worry you make it double  
Don't [E] worry, be [B] happy 
 
## Chorus

(Whistle)

[B] [C#m] [E] [B] (x2)

## Verse 2

[B] Ain't got no place to lay your head  
[C#m] Somebody came and took your bed  
Don't [E] worry, be [B] happy  

The [B] landlord say your rent is late  
[C#m] He may have to litigate  
Don't [E] worry, be [B] happy

## Chorus

(Whistle)

[B] [C#m] [E] [B] (x2)

## Verse 3

[B] Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style  
[C#m] Ain't got no girl to make you smile  
**But** don't [E] worry, be [B] happy

Cause [B] when you worry, your face will frown  
[C#m] And that will bring everybody down  
**So** don't [E] worry, be [B] happy

## Chorus

(Whistle)

[B] [C#m] [E] [B] (x2)

## Verse 4

[B] There is this little song I wrote  
[C#m] I hope you learn it note for note  
Don't [E] worry, be [B] happy

(Listen to what I say!)

[B] In your life expect some trouble 
[C#m] But when you worry, you make it double 
Don't [E] worry, be [B] happy

## Chorus

(Whistle)

[B] [C#m] [E] [B] (x2)

_(Repeat and fade out)_
