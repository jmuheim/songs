## Intro

[Em(2)] [D6] [CM7] [Cm6] [B7(2)]  
[Em] [Am] [Cdim7] [B7(3)] [B7(4)]

[Em(3)] [D6] [CM7] [Cm6] [B7(2)]  
[Em] [Am] [Em]

## Verse 1

[Em(2)] "The problem is [D6] all inside your head"  
[CM7] she said to me [Cm6] [B7(2)]  
[Em] "the answer is ea[Am]sy if you  
[Cdim7] take it logic'lly. [B7(3)] [B7(4)]

[Em(3)] I'd like to help [D6] you in your  
[CM7] struggle to be free [Cm6] [B7(2)]  
there must be [Em] fifty ways [Am]  
to leave your lov[Em]er."

---

[Em(2)] She said, "It's [D6] really not my  
[CM7] habit to intrude [Cm6] [B7(2)]  
Further[Em]more I hope my mea[Am]ning won't be  
lost [Cdim7] or misconstrued. [B7(3)] [B7(4)]

But I'll re[Em(3)]peat myself [D6] at the  
[CM7] risk of being crude [Cm6] there [B7(2)] must be  
[Em] fifty ways [Am] to leave your lov[Em]er  
[Em] fifty ways [Am7] to leave your lov[Em]er

_(Riff)_

## Chorus

_(Rhythm guitar)_

Just slip out the back, [G] Jack
Make a new [Bb] plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, [C] Roy
Just listen to me [G]

Hop on the bus, [G] Gus
You don't need to discuss [Bb] much
Just drop off the key, [C] Lee
and get yourself free [G]

_(x2)_

## Verse 2

[Em(2)] She said, "It [D6] grieves me so to  
[CM7] see you in such pain [Cm6] [B7(2)]  
oh I wish [Em] there's somethin' [Am] I could do to  
[Cdim7] make you smile again." [B7(3)] And I said [B7(4)]

"I a[Em(3)]ppreciate that, [D6] and  
[CM7] could you please explain [Cm6] about [B7(2)]  
the fifty wa[Em]ys?" [Am] [Em]

---

[Em(2)] She said, "Why [D6] don't we both just  
[CM7] sleep on it tonight [Cm6] [B7(2)]  
I be[Em]lieve that in the mor[Am]ning  
you'll be[Cdim7]gin to see the light. [B7(3)] And then [B7(4)]

she [Em(3)] kissed me and I [D6] realized she  
[CM7] probably was right [Cm6] there [B7(2)] must be  
[Em] fifty ways [Am] to leave your lov[Em]er  
[Em] fifty ways [Am7] to leave your lov[Em]er

_(Riff)_
 
## Chorus

_(Rhythm guitar)_

Just slip out the back, [G] Jack
Make a new [Bb] plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, [C] Roy
Just listen to me [G]

Hop on the bus, [G] Gus
You don't need to discuss [Bb] much
Just drop off the key, [C] Lee
and get yourself free [G]
