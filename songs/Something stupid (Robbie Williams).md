# Something stupid (Robbie Williams)

## Instructions

```
Sounds best with some barre chords:

   |E A D G B e|
   |-----------|
C  |x 3 5 5 5 3| To slide easily into Eb
Eb |x 6 8 8 8 6|
G6 |3 5 5 4 3 0| Thumb for E string
G  |3 5 5 4 3 3| To change easily to G7
G7 |3 5 3 4 3 3| To change easily to C

If you want to avoid barre chords:

Eb |x x 5 4 4 3|
G6 |3 2 0 0 3 0|

And some more chords:

D+ |x x 0 3 3 2| To switch from D, point pinky on G string
```

## Verse 1

I [G6] know I stand in line  
until you think you have the time  
to spend an [Am] evening with me [D7] [Am] [D7]

And [Am] if we go some[D7]place to dance  
I [Am] know that there's a chance [D7]  
you won't be [G6] leaving with me

---

Then [G] afterwards we drop  
into a [G7] quiet little place  
and have a [C] drink or two [Eb]

And [Am] then I go and [D7] spoil it all  
by [Am] saying something [D7] stupid  
like: "I [G6] love you"

## Bridge

I can [G] see it in your eyes  
that you de[G7]spise the same old lies  
you heard the [C] night before

And [A7] though it's just a line to you  
For me it's true and  
never seemed so [D] right before [D+]

## Verse 2

I [G6] practice every day  
to find some clever lines to say to make  
the [Am] meaning come through [D7] [Am] [D7]

But [Am] then I think I'll [D7] wait until  
the [Am] evening gets late [D7]  
and I'm [G6] alone with you

---

The [G] time is right  
your perfume fills my [G7] head  
the stars get red  
and oh the [C] night's so blue [Eb]

And [Am] then I go and [D7] spoil it all  
by [Am] saying something [D7] stupid  
like: "I [G6] love you"

## Bridge

_(Instrumental only, maybe add whistling)_

[G] [G7] [C] 
[A7] [D] [D+]
 
## Verse 2

I [G6] practice every day  
to find some clever lines to say to make  
the [Am] meaning come through [D7] [Am] [D7]

But [Am] then I think I'll [D7] wait until  
the [Am] evening gets late [D7]  
and I'm [G6] alone with you

---

The [G] time is right  
your perfume fills my [G7] head  
the stars get red  
and oh the [C] night's so blue [Eb]

And [Am] then I go and [D7] spoil it all  
by [Am] saying something [D7] stupid  
like: "I [G] love you" [Eb]

I [G] love you [Eb] _(Repeat and fade)_
