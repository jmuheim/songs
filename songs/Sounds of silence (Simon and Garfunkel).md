# ‚≠ê Sounds of silence (Simon and Garfunkel)

## Verse 1

[Am] Hello darkness, my old [G] friend  
I've come to talk with you a[Am]gain  
Because a vision softly [F] cree[C]ping  
[F] Left its seeds while I was slee[C]ping

And the [F] vision that was planted  
in my [C] brain still re[Am]mains  
[C]Within the [G] sound of [Am] silence
 
## Verse 2

In restless dreams I walked a[G]lone  
Narrow streets of cobble[Am]stone  
'neath the halo of a [F] street [C] lamp  
I turned my collar to the [F] cold and [C] damp

When my [F] eyes were stabbed  
by the flash of a neon [C] light  
That split the night [Am]  
[C] And touched the [G] sound of [Am] silence
 
## Verse 3

And in the naked light I [G] saw  
Ten thousand people, maybe [Am] more  
People talking with[F]out speak[C]ing  
People hearing with[F]out lis[C]tening

People writing [F] songs  
that voices never share [C]  
And no one [Am] dare  
[C] Disturb the sound [G] of [Am] silence
 
## Verse 4

Fools said I, you do not [G] know  
Silence like a cancer [Am] grows  
Hear my words that I might [F] teach [C] you  
Take my arms that I might [F] reach you [C]

But my [F] words like silent raindrops [C] fell [Am]  
_(Pause)_  
[C] And echoed  
In the [G] wells of [Am] silence  
 
## Verse 5

And the people bowed and [G] prayed  
To the neon God they [Am] made  
And the sign flashed out [F] its war[C]ning  
In the words that it was [F] forming [C]
                       
And the sign said the [F] words of the prophets  
Are written on the subway [C] walls  
And tenement [Am] halls  
And [C] whisper'd in the [G] sounds of [Am] silence
