# Sittin' on the dock of the bay (Otis Redding)
 
## Verse 1

[G] Sittin' in the mornin' sun [B7]  
I'll be [C] sittin' when the evenin' comes [A]  
[G] Watching the ships roll in [B7]  
And then I [C] watch 'em roll away again [A] yeah

## Chorus

I'm [G] sittin' on the dock of the [E] bay  
Watching the [G] tide roll [E]away, ooo  
I'm just [G] sittin' on the dock of the [A] bay  
Wastin' [G] time [E]

## Verse 2

I [G] left my home in [B7] Georgia  
[C] Headed for the 'Frisco Bay [A]  
[G] 'Cause I've had nothing to [B7] live for  
And look like [C] nothin's gonna come my way [A]

## Chorus

~~I'm sittin'~~ **So I'm just gonna [G] sit** on the dock of the [E] bay  
Watching the [G] tide roll [E]away, ooh  
~~I'm just~~ **Ooo I'm** [G] sittin' on the dock of the [A] bay  
Wastin' [G] time [E]

## Bridge

                         
[G] Looks like [D] nothing's [C] gonna change [G]  
[G] Everything [D] still remains [C] the same [G]  
[G] I can't [D] do what [C] ten people [G] tell me to do  
So I [F] guess I'll remain the [D] same, yes

## Chorus

**Now** I'm [G] sitting on the dock of the [E] bay  
Watching the [G] tide roll [E]away, ooh  
~~I'm just~~ **Ooo I'm** [G] sittin' on the dock of the [A] bay  
Wastin' [G] time [E]

_(Repeat and whistle, fade)_
