_(Repeat with solo)_

## Verse 1

[C] So, so you think you can [D] tell  
heaven from [Am] hell?  
Blue skies from [G] pain?  
Can you tell a green [D] field  
from a cold steel [C] rail?  
A smile from a [Am] veil?  
Do you think you can [G] tell?

## Verse 2

Did they get you to [C] trade  
your heroes for [D] ghosts?  
Hot ashes for [Am] trees?  
Hot air for a [G] cool breeze?  
Cold comfort for [D] change?  
And did you ex[C]change  
a walk-on part in the [Am] war  
for a lead role in a [G] cage?

## Chorus

[C] How I wish  
how I wish you were [D] here  
We're just [Am] two lost souls  
swimming in a fishbowl  
[G] year after year  
[D] Running over the same old ground  
[C] what have we found?  
The same old [Am] fears  
Wish you were [G] here
