# Jolene (Dolly Parton)

## Intro

`Am`{.a} _(4 bars)_
 
## Chorus

Jo`Am`{.a}lene, Jo`C`{.c}lene, Jo`G`{.g}lene, Jo`Am`{.a}lene  
I'm `G`{.g} begging of you  
please don't take my `Am`{.a} man  
Jo`Am`{.a}lene, Jo`C`{.c}lene, Jo`G`{.g}lene, Jo`Am`{.a}lene  
`G`{.g} Please don't take him  
`Em`{.e} just because you `Am`{.a} can
 
## Verse 1

Your `Am`{.a} beauty is be`C`{.c}yond compare  
With `G`{.g} flaming locks of `Am`{.a} auburn hair  
With `G`{.g} ivory skin  
and `Em`{.e} eyes of emerald `Am`{.a} green  
Your `Am`{.a} smile is like a `C`{.c} breath of spring  
Your `G`{.g} voice is soft like `Am`{.a} summer rain  
And `G`{.g} I cannot com`Em`{.e}pete with you  
`Am`{.a} Jolene

## Verse 2

He `Am`{.a} talks about you `C`{.c} in his sleep  
There's `G`{.g} nothing I can `Am`{.a} do to keep  
From `G`{.g} crying when he `Em`{.e} calls your name  
Jo`Am`{.a}lene  
And `Am`{.a} I can easily `C`{.c} understand  
How `G`{.g} you could easily `Am`{.a} take my man  
But you `G`{.g} don't know what he `Em`{.e} means to me  
Jo`Am`{.a}lene

## Chorus

_(Like 1st time)_

Jo`Am`{.a}lene, Jo`C`{.c}lene, Jo`G`{.g}lene, Jo`Am`{.a}lene  
I'm `G`{.g} begging of you  
please don't take my `Am`{.a} man  
Jo`Am`{.a}lene, Jo`C`{.c}lene, Jo`G`{.g}lene, Jo`Am`{.a}lene  
`G`{.g} Please don't take him  

## Verse 3

`Am`{.a} You could have your `C`{.c} choice of men  
But `G`{.g} I could never `Am`{.a} love again  
`G`{.g} He's the only `Em`{.e} one for me  
Jo`Am`{.a}lene  
I `Am`{.a} had to have this `C`{.c} talk with you  
My `G`{.g} happiness de`Am`{.a}pends on you  
What`G`{.g}ever you de`Em`{.e}cide to do  
Jo`Am`{.a}lene
 
## Chorus

_(Like before, except...)_

Jo`Am`{.a}lene, Jo`C`{.c}lene, Jo`G`{.g}lene, Jo`Am`{.a}lene  
I'm `G`{.g} begging of you  
please don't take my `Am`{.a} man  
Jo`Am`{.a}lene, Jo`C`{.c}lene, Jo`G`{.g}lene, Jo`Am`{.a}lene  
`G`{.g} Please don't take him  
`Em`{.e} ~~just because~~ **even though** you `Am`{.a} can

`F`{.f} And the `C`{.c} dreams that you dream of  
`G`{.g} dreams really do come `Am`{.a} true `F`{.f}

## Verse 2

Some`C`{.c}day i'll wish upon a star  
`G`{.g} To wake up where the clouds are far  
be`Am`{.a}hind `F`{.f} me

you'll `F`{.f} find me

Oh `C`{.c} somewhere `Em`{.e} over the rainbow

The `G`{.g} colours of the rainbow  
so `C`{.c} pretty in the sky  
Are `G`{.g} also on the faces

`G`{.g} why oh why can't `Am`{.a} I? `F`{.f}

`F`{.f} ooo-ooo `C`{.c} ooo-ooo  
`F`{.f} ooo-ooo `E7`{.e} ooo-ooo
