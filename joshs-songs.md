# Wish you were here (Pink Floyd)

## Intro

`Em` / `G`  
`Em` / `G`  
`Em` / `Am7`  
`Em` / `Am7`  
`G` / `G`

(Repeat with solo)

## 1st verse (1/2)

`C` So, so you think you can `D` tell  
heaven from `Am` hell?  
Blue skies from `G` pain?  
Can you tell a green `D` field  
from a cold steel `C` rail?  
A smile from a `Am` veil?  
Do you think you can `G` tell?

## 1st verse (2/2)

Did they get you to `C` trade  
your heroes for `D` ghosts?  
Hot ashes for `Am` trees?  
Hot air for a `G` cool breeze?  
Cold comfort for `D` change  
And did you ex`C`change  
a walk-on part in the `Am` war  
for a lead role in a `G` cage

## Verse 2

`C` How I wish  
how I wish you were `D` here  
We're just `Am` two lost souls  
swimming in a fishbowl `G`  
year after year `D`  
Running over the same old ground `C`  
what have we found  
the same old `Am` fears?  
Wish you were `G` here
