# Dolly Parton: Jolene

## Intro

Am (4 bars)
 
## Chorus

Jo`Am`lene, Jo`C`lene, Jo`G`lene, Jo`Am`lene  
I'm `G` begging of you,  
please don't take my `Am` man  
Jo`Am`lene, Jo`C`lene, Jo`G`lene, Jo`Am`lene  
`G` Please don't take him  
`Em` just because you `Am` can
 
## Verse 1

```
       Am        C
Your beauty is beyond compare

       G                Am
With flaming locks of auburn hair

       G             Em              Am
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

       Am             C
Your smile is like a breath of spring

       G                  Am
Your voice is soft like summer rain

       G         Em             Am
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
```
 
## Verse 2

```
    Am             C
He talks about you in his sleep

     G                Am
There's nothing I can do to keep

       G             Em               Am
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

    Am            C
And I can easily understand

    G                 Am
How you could easily take my man

         G                  Em           Am
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
```
 
## Chorus

```
  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

      G                                 Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man

  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

  G                    Em             Am
Please don't take him just because you can
```
 
## Verse 3

```
Am                    C
You could have your choice of men

    G              Am
But I could never love again

   G           Em           Am
He's the only one for me, Jolene

   Am               C
I had to have this talk with you

    G           Am
My happiness depends on you

    G           Em           Am
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene
```
 
## Chorus

  Am      C       G       Am  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
  
      G                                 Am  
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man  
  
  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

  G                    Em            Am
Please don't take him _even though_ you can

# Pink Floyd: Wish you were here

## Intro

`Em` / `G`
`Em` / `G`
`Em` / `Am7`
`Em` / `Am7`
`G` / `G`

(Repeat with solo)

## Verse 1

`C` So, so you think you can `D` tell
heaven from `Am` hell?
Blue skies from `G` pain?
Can you tell a green `D` field
from a cold steel `C` rail?
A smile from a `Am` veil?
Do you think you can `G` tell?

## Verse 2

Did they get you to `C` trade
your heroes for `D` ghosts?
Hot ashes for `Am` trees?
Hot air for a `G` cool breeze?
Cold comfort for `D` change
And did you ex`C`change
a walk-on part in the `Am` war
for a lead role in a `G` cage

## Interlude

(Like intro)

## Chorus

`C` How I wish
how I wish you were `D` here
We're just `Am` two lost souls
swimming in a fishbowl `G`
year after year `D`
Running over the same old ground `C`
what have we found
the same old `Am` fears?
Wish you were `G` here
