# Dolly Parton: Jolene

## Intro

Am _(4 bars)_
 
## Chorus

Jo`Am`lene, Jo`C`lene, Jo`G`lene, Jo`Am`lene  
I'm `G` begging of you,  
please don't take my `Am` man  
Jo`Am`lene, Jo`C`lene, Jo`G`lene, Jo`Am`lene  
`G` Please don't take him  
`Em` just because you `Am` can
 
## Verse 1

Your `Am` beauty is be`C`yond compare  
With `G` flaming locks of `Am` auburn hair  
With `G` ivory skin  
and `Em` eyes of emerald `Am` green  
Your `Am` smile is like a `C` breath of spring  
Your `G` voice is soft like `Am` summer rain  
And `G` I cannot com`Em`pete with you, `Am` Jolene

## Verse 2

He `Am` talks about you `C` in his sleep  
There's `G` nothing I can `Am` do to keep  
From `G` crying when he `Em` calls your name, Jo`Am`lene  
And `Am` I can easily `C` understand  
How `G` you could easily `Am` take my man  
But you `G` don't know what he `Em` means to me, Jo`Am`lene

## Chorus

> (Like 1st time)

## Verse 3

`Am` You could have your `C` choice of men  
But `G` I could never `Am` love again  
`G` He's the only `Em` one for me, Jo`Am`lene  
I `Am` had to have this `C` talk with you  
My `G` happiness de`Am`pends on you  
What`G`ever you de`Em`cide to do, Jo`Am`lene
 
## Chorus

> (Like 1st time, except last line)

...Please don't take him **even though** you can

# The river is flowing

## Verse 1

> (Chords sequence is the same through whole song)

The `Am` river is `C` flowing, `G` flowing in `Am` growing,  
the river is flowing back to the sea.  
Mother Earth is caring me, her child I will always be,  
Mother Earth is caring me, back to the sea
 
## Verse 2

The Moon she is waiting, waxing and waning  
the Moon she is waiting, for us to be free.  
Sister Moon watch over me, a child I will always be.  
Sister Moon watch over me, until we are free  
 
## Verse 3

The Sun he is shining, brightly heÂ´s shining,  
the Sun he is shining, lightning the way.  
Father Sun shine over me, your child I will always be,  
father Sun shine over me, until we can see!  
 
## Verse 4

The Fire is burning, destroying and healing,  
the Fire is burning, for us to get pure.  
Violet Flame burn over me, a child I will always be,  
violet Flame burn over me, until we are pure

# Pink Floyd: Wish you were here

## Intro

`G`{.x} / `Em`{.x}  
`G`{.x} / `Em`{.x}  
`G`{.x} / `Em`{.x}  
`A`{.x} / `Em`{.x}  
`A`{.x} / `G`{.x}

> (Repeat with solo)

## Verse 1

`C` So, so you think you can `D` tell  
heaven from `Am` hell?  
Blue skies from `G` pain?  
Can you tell a green `D` field  
from a cold steel `C` rail?  
A smile from a `Am` veil?  
Do you think you can `G` tell?

## Verse 2

Did they get you to `C` trade  
your heroes for `D` ghosts?  
Hot ashes for `Am` trees?  
Hot air for a `G` cool breeze?  
Cold comfort for `D` change  
And did you ex`C`change  
a walk-on part in the `Am` war  
for a lead role in a `G` cage...

## Interlude

> (Like intro, but do not repeat)

## Chorus

`C` How I wish  
how I wish you were `D` here  
We're just `Am` two lost souls  
swimming in a fishbowl `G`  
year after year `D`  
Running over the same old ground `C`  
what have we found  
the same old `Am` fears?  
Wish you were `G` here
