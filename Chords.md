# Introduction

## Welcome

This is a collection of Monika's first guitar songs.  
🎤😍🎸🔥

All songs only use the beginner friendly open chords (Am, C, D, etc.) and no variations (like A7) or advanced chords (like F). Alas, some of the songs have been simplified a bit or transposed to a different key (feel free to use a capo to adjust to your voice or the original song).

Let's sing together and have some fun! 💫

🙏 Cheers 🌛
